# Contributing to the Nextellar Organization

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Nextellar.

This document describes **how contributions work across the Nextellar GitHub organization**. Individual repositories may define additional or more specific guidelines. Always check a repository’s `CONTRIBUTING.md` for repo-specific instructions.

---

## Scope of This Guide

This guide applies to **all repositories** under the Nextellar GitHub organization, including but not limited to:

* CLI tooling
* Documentation
* Examples and templates
* Supporting libraries and utilities

It is intentionally lightweight and focuses on shared expectations, not implementation details.

---

## How We Work

Nextellar follows contribution practices common to modern developer tooling organizations (e.g. Vercel, Prisma, Turborepo):

* Clear issues before large changes
* Small, reviewable pull requests
* Strong emphasis on developer experience and maintainability
* Documentation treated as a first-class contribution

---

## Ways to Contribute

You can contribute by:

* Reporting bugs or regressions
* Proposing features or improvements
* Improving documentation or examples
* Fixing issues and submitting pull requests
* Reviewing pull requests or participating in discussions

All contributions are valued, regardless of size.

---

## Issues & Proposals

Before starting work:

* Search existing issues to avoid duplicates
* For non-trivial changes, open an issue to discuss the approach
* Clearly describe the problem being solved and why it matters

Well-scoped issues lead to faster reviews and better outcomes.

---

## Repository-Specific Guidelines

Each repository may include its own `CONTRIBUTING.md` covering:

* Local setup instructions
* Build and test workflows
* Coding standards and tooling
* Review requirements

If a repository provides additional guidance, **that guidance takes precedence** over this document.

---

## Pull Requests

General expectations for pull requests across the organization:

* Keep changes focused and intentional
* Write clear commit messages
* Explain **what** changed and **why** in the PR description
* Link related issues where applicable

Avoid bundling unrelated changes into a single pull request.

---

## Documentation Contributions

Documentation is a core part of the Nextellar developer experience.

* Small improvements are encouraged
* Typos, clarifications, and examples are all valuable
* Not all documentation changes require local builds or tests

When in doubt, open a pull request and ask for guidance.

---

## Code Quality & Style

Across all repositories, we value:

* Readability over cleverness
* Consistent patterns
* Clear naming and structure
* Maintainable abstractions

Automated checks may vary by repository.

---

## Reviews & Maintainers

Pull requests are reviewed by maintainers of the relevant repository.

* Feedback is intended to be constructive
* Discussion is encouraged when trade-offs exist
* Maintainers may request changes to align with project direction

---

## Code of Conduct

All contributors are expected to interact respectfully and professionally.

Harassment, abuse, or exclusionary behavior will not be tolerated.

---

## License

By contributing to any Nextellar repository, you agree that your contributions will be licensed under the same license as that repository.

---

Thank you for helping build the Nextellar ecosystem.
