**The unified developer platform for building, deploying, and scaling applications on Stellar.**

Nextellar is a modern, developer-first toolchain designed to remove friction from building on the Stellar ecosystem. It provides a production-ready CLI for scaffolding applications and, in its roadmap, a tightly integrated hosting platform that takes projects from local development to production with minimal configuration.

Inspired by the role Vercel plays for Next.js, Nextellar aims to become the default entry point for Stellar developers.

## What is Nextellar?

Nextellar is a modular, TypeScript-first CLI and platform built to accelerate development on Stellar and Soroban. It enables developers to:

* Scaffold production-ready applications in minutes
* Work with opinionated but customizable defaults
* Integrate wallets, network configuration, and Stellar tooling out of the box
* Move seamlessly from local development toward hosted, production deployments

Nextellar focuses on developer experience first, reducing repetitive setup and allowing teams to spend more time building real features instead of reconfiguring the same tooling for every project.

---

## Why Nextellar

Building on blockchain often involves unnecessary complexity at the very first step. Nextellar exists to eliminate that friction.

**Problems it solves:**

* Repetitive project setup across teams and repositories
* Manual Stellar network and wallet configuration
* Inconsistent project structure and tooling
* Slow onboarding for new developers

**What makes Nextellar different:**

* Lightweight and modular CLI
* TypeScript-first and ESM-native
* Opinionated defaults that remain fully customizable
* Designed specifically for Stellar and Soroban workflows

---

## Repository Overview

This GitHub organization hosts the core building blocks of the Nextellar ecosystem.

### `nextellar`

The main repository containing the Nextellar CLI.

* CLI entry point
* Project and component scaffolding
* Plugin and extension system
* Stellar-specific developer tooling

This is the primary repository for developers who want to install, use, or contribute to the CLI.

### `docs`

The official documentation source for Nextellar.

* Getting started guides
* CLI command reference
* Architectural explanations
* Best practices and examples

The documentation is intended to serve both new and experienced developers.

---

## Core Concepts

Nextellar is built around a few key ideas:

### One-Command Onboarding

Developers should be able to start building immediately with minimal setup.

### Opinionated, Not Restrictive

Nextellar provides sensible defaults while allowing teams to override or extend configuration as needed.

### Modular by Design

The CLI is designed to grow via plugins and scaffolds without becoming bloated or monolithic.

### Production-Oriented

Projects generated by Nextellar follow patterns suitable for real-world, production applications.

---

## Nextellar CLI

The Nextellar CLI is the foundation of the platform. It acts as the primary interface for managing projects, scaffolding code, and integrating Stellar tooling.

### Features

* **Project Initialization**

  * Scaffold new applications with production-ready defaults
  * TypeScript-first setup

* **Stellar Configuration**

  * Automatic Horizon network configuration
  * Sensible defaults for Stellar development

* **Wallet Adapter Scaffolding**

  * Preconfigured wallet adapters
  * Simplified authentication and transaction flows

* **Extensible Architecture**

  * Plugin-ready command structure
  * Designed for future ecosystem growth

* **Developer Experience**

  * Clear error messages and diagnostics
  * Consistent project structure

### Installation

Using `npx`:

```bash
npx nextellar my-app
```

Or install globally:

```bash
npm install -g nextellar
```

### Basic Usage

Initialize a new project:

```bash
nextellar init my-app
```

Run the project locally using your preferred package manager after scaffolding.

Additional commands and workflows are documented in detail in the `docs` repository.

---

## Documentation

All official documentation lives in the `docs` repository and the hosted documentation site.

Documentation covers:

* Getting started guides
* CLI command reference
* Project structure explanations
* Stellar and Soroban integration patterns
* Advanced usage and best practices

If you are new to Nextellar, the documentation is the recommended starting point.

---

## Architecture & Design Principles

* **TypeScript-first**: Strong typing and modern tooling by default
* **ESM-compatible**: Built for modern Node.js environments
* **Cross-platform**: Works on macOS, Linux, and Windows
* **Lightweight**: Keeps the CLI focused and fast

Nextellar is not a framework replacement. It complements existing frameworks like Next.js by standardizing setup and tooling around them.

---

## Roadmap

Nextellar is actively evolving. Planned and ongoing work includes:

### CLI Enhancements

* Additional starter templates
* Expanded scaffolding options
* Advanced wallet and network configurations
* Improved diagnostics and developer feedback

### Hosting Platform (Planned)

* One-command deployment workflows
* Frontend hosting for Nextellar-generated apps
* Soroban smart contract deployment and management
* Future support for APIs, edge functions, and analytics

### Ecosystem Growth

* Plugin marketplace
* Community-driven templates
* Educational content and examples
